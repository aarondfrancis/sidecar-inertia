# Sidecar SSR for InertiaJS

> ðŸš¨ This is currently very much in beta!

You can see a fully working Jetstream + Inertia + Sidecar demo repo at [hammerstonedev/sidecar-inertia-demo](https://github.com/hammerstonedev/sidecar-inertia-demo).

## Overview 

This package provides a Sidecar function to run [Inertia server-side rendering](https://inertiajs.com/server-side-rendering) on AWS Lambda.

Sidecar packages, deploys, and executes AWS Lambda functions from your Laravel application.

It works with any Laravel 7 or 8 application, hosted anywhere including your local machine, Vapor, Heroku, a shared virtual server, or any other kind of hosting environment.

Both [Webpack](#webpack-instructions) (Laravel Mix) and [Vite](#vite-instructions) are supported.

- [Sidecar docs](https://hammerstone.dev/sidecar/docs/main/overview)
- [Sidecar GitHub](https://github.com/hammerstonedev/sidecar)


## Installation

To require this package, run the following: 

```shell
composer require hammerstone/sidecar-inertia
```

This will install Sidecar as well.

## Using the Sidecar Gateway 

Update your `AppServiceProvider` to use the `SidecarGateway` as the default Inertia SSR Gateway

```php
namespace App\Providers;

use Hammerstone\Sidecar\Inertia\SidecarGateway;
use Illuminate\Support\ServiceProvider;
use Inertia\Ssr\Gateway;

class AppServiceProvider extends ServiceProvider
{
    public function register()
    {
        // Use Sidecar to run Inertia SSR.
        $this->app->instance(Gateway::class, new SidecarGateway);
    }
}
```

## Vite Instructions
If your app uses Webpack (Laravel Mix), skip to the [Webpack Instructions](#webpack-instructions).

### Enabling SSR

If you just installed a fresh Laravel Jetstream app with the --ssr flag, you can skip this step.

Make sure that `inertia/laravel-inertia` is at least version `0.5.1`.

Add `@inertiaHead` to the end of the `<head>` section of your `app.blade.php` file:
```html
<html>
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0" />
    ...
    @inertiaHead
  </head>
  <body>
    @inertia
  </body>
</html>
```

Publish the `inertia.php` config to your config folder if it doesn't exist:
`php artisan vendor:publish --provider="Inertia\ServiceProvider"`

### Updating Configuration

Update your `config/inertia.php` to include the Sidecar settings

```php
<?php

return [
    'ssr' => [
        'enabled' => true,

        'sidecar' => [
            // The Sidecar function that handles the SSR for Vite builds.
            'handler' => \Hammerstone\Sidecar\Inertia\ViteSSR::class,
            
            // Log some stats on how long each Lambda request takes.
            'timings' => false,
            
            // Throw exceptions, should they occur.
            'debug' => env('APP_DEBUG', false),
            
            // Compile Ziggy routes with the Lambda function.
            'ziggy' => false
        ],
    ],

    // ...
];
```

### Configuring Sidecar

If you haven't already, you'll need to configure Sidecar.

Publish the `sidecar.php` configuration file by running 

```shell
php artisan sidecar:install
```

To configure your Sidecar AWS credentials interactively, you can run 

```shell
php artisan sidecar:configure
```

The [official Sidecar docs](https://hammerstone.dev/sidecar/docs/main/configuration) go into much further detail.

Now update your `config/sidecar.php` to include the function shipped with this package.

```php
<?php

return [
    'functions' => [
        \Hammerstone\Sidecar\Inertia\ViteSSR::class
    ],
    
    // ...
];
```

### Updating Your JavaScript

> This only covers Vue3, please follow the Inertia docs for Vue2 or React, and please open any issues.

Update your `vite.config.js` to include the following. If you're using [Ziggy](https://github.com/tighten/ziggy), you'll want to uncomment the Ziggy stuff:

```js
import { defineConfig } from "vite";
import laravel from "laravel-vite-plugin";
import vue from "@vitejs/plugin-vue";

export default defineConfig({
    plugins: [
        laravel({
            input: "resources/js/app.js",
            ssr: "resources/js/ssr.js",
            refresh: true,
        }),
        vue({
            template: {
                transformAssetUrls: {
                    base: null,
                    includeAbsolute: false,
                },
            },
        }),
    ],
    // Uncomment the following if using Ziggy:
    // build: {
    //     rollupOptions: {
    //         external: ["./compiledZiggy.mjs"],
    //     },
    // },
    ssr: {
        noExternal: ["@inertiajs/server"],
    },
});
```

And update your `resources/js/ssr.js` to look something like this. The specifics may vary based on your application. 

```js
import { createSSRApp, h } from "vue";
import { renderToString } from "@vue/server-renderer";
import { createInertiaApp } from "@inertiajs/inertia-vue3";
import { resolvePageComponent } from "laravel-vite-plugin/inertia-helpers";
// import { ZiggyVue } from "../../vendor/tightenco/ziggy/dist/vue.m";

const appName = "Laravel";

export async function handler(event) {
    // This is the file that Sidecar has compiled for us if
    // this application uses Ziggy. We import it using
    // this syntax since it may not exist at all.
    // const compiledZiggy = await import("./compiledZiggy.mjs");

    return await createInertiaApp({
        page: event,
        render: renderToString,
        resolve: (name) =>
            resolvePageComponent(
                `./Pages/${name}.vue`,
                import.meta.glob("./Pages/**/*.vue")
            ),
        setup({ app, props, plugin }) {
            // const Ziggy = {
            //     // Start with the stuff that may be baked into this Lambda.
            //     ...(compiledZiggy?.default || {}),

            //     // Then if they passed anything to us via the event,
            //     // overwrite everything that was baked in.
            //     ...event?.props?.ziggy,
            // };

            // // Construct a new location, since window.location is not available.
            // Ziggy.location = new URL(Ziggy.location);

            return createSSRApp({
                render: () => h(app, props),
            })
                .use(plugin)
                // .use(ZiggyVue, Ziggy);
        },
    });
}
```

## Webpack Instructions

### Enabling SSR

Following the [official Inertia docs](https://inertiajs.com/server-side-rendering#enabling-ssr) on enabling SSR is a good place to start, but there are a few things you can skip:
 
- You do not need to `npm install @inertiajs/server`
- You do not need to `npm install webpack-node-externals`
- Come back here when you get to the "Building your application" section

Make sure that `inertia/laravel-inertia` is at least version `0.5.1`.

### Updating Configuration

Update your `config/inertia.php` to include the Sidecar settings

```php
<?php

return [
    'ssr' => [
        'enabled' => true,

        'sidecar' => [
            // The Sidecar function that handles the SSR.
            'handler' => \Hammerstone\Sidecar\Inertia\SSR::class,
            
            // Log some stats on how long each Lambda request takes.
            'timings' => false,
            
            // Throw exceptions, should they occur.
            'debug' => env('APP_DEBUG', false),
            
            // Compile Ziggy routes with the Lambda function.
            'ziggy' => false
        ],
    ],

    // ...
];
```

### Configuring Sidecar

If you haven't already, you'll need to configure Sidecar.

Publish the `sidecar.php` configuration file by running 

```shell
php artisan sidecar:install
```

To configure your Sidecar AWS credentials interactively, you can run 

```shell
php artisan sidecar:configure
```

The [official Sidecar docs](https://hammerstone.dev/sidecar/docs/main/configuration) go into much further detail.

Now update your `config/sidecar.php` to include the function shipped with this package.

```php
<?php

return [
    'functions' => [
        \Hammerstone\Sidecar\Inertia\SSR::class
    ],
    
    // ...
];
```

### Updating Your JavaScript

> This only covers Vue3, please follow the Inertia docs for Vue2 or React, and please open any issues.

You'll need to update your `webpack.ssr.mix.js` file. This _should_ work for most cases, but please open any issues for errors you run into. (This is based on the Inertia docs, with slight modifications.)

```js
const path = require('path')
const mix = require('laravel-mix')

mix
    .js('resources/js/ssr.js', 'public/js')
    .options({
        manifest: false
    })
    .vue({
        version: 3,
        useVueStyleLoader: true,
        options: {
            optimizeSSR: true
        }
    })
    .alias({
        '@': path.resolve('resources/js')
    })
    .webpackConfig({
        target: 'node',
        externals: {
            node: true,
            // Sidecar will ship a file called compiledZiggy as a part of
            // the package. We don't want webpack to try to inline it
            // because it doesn't exist at the time webpack runs.
            // './compiledZiggy': 'require("./compiledZiggy")'
        },
        resolve: {
            alias: {
                // Uncomment if you're using Ziggy.
                // ziggy: path.resolve('vendor/tightenco/ziggy/src/js'),
            },
        },
    })
```

And update your `resources/js/ssr.js` to look something like this. The specifics may vary based on your application. If you're using [Ziggy](https://github.com/tighten/ziggy), you'll want to uncomment the Ziggy stuff. (This is based on the Inertia docs, with slight modifications.)

```js
import {createSSRApp, h} from 'vue'
import {renderToString} from '@vue/server-renderer'
import {createInertiaApp} from '@inertiajs/inertia-vue3'
// import route from 'ziggy';

exports.handler = async function (event) {
    // This is the file that Sidecar has compiled for us if
    // this application uses Ziggy. We import it using
    // this syntax since it may not exist at all.
    // const compiledZiggy = await import('./compiledZiggy');

    return await createInertiaApp({
        page: event,
        render: renderToString,
        resolve: (name) => require(`./Pages/${name}`),
        setup({app, props, plugin}) {
            // const Ziggy = {
            //     // Start with the stuff that may be baked into this Lambda.
            //     ...(compiledZiggy || {}),
            // 
            //     // Then if they passed anything to us via the event,
            //     // overwrite everything that was baked in.
            //     ...event?.props?.ziggy,
            // }

            // Construct a new location, since window.location is not available.
            // Ziggy.location = new URL(Ziggy.url)

            return createSSRApp({
                render: () => h(app, props),
            }).use(plugin).mixin({
                methods: {
                    // Use our custom Ziggy object as the config.
                    // route: (name, params, absolute, config = Ziggy) => route(name, params, absolute, config),
                },
            })
        },
    });
}
```

## Deploying Your SSR Function

After you have added the SSR function to your `sidecar.php`, you should run `php artisan sidecar:deploy --activate` to
deploy your function. 

This will compile your JavaScript for you as a `beforeDeployment` hook, so you don't have to worry about remembering to do that first.

## Debugging SSR

It's recommended that you deploy your Sidecar function locally so that you can test SSR more quickly. You can run `php artisan sidecar:deploy --activate` from your local machine and your SSR function will be deployed to Lambda.

You can also set `ssr.sidecar.debug` to `true` in your `config/inertia.php` file, so that Sidecar will throw exceptions when SSR fails instead of falling back to client-side rendering. This will help you diagnose issues quickly. 

## Ziggy (Optional)

If you are using Ziggy, you'll need to pass some Ziggy information along to your Lambda. You can do that by adding the following to your
`HandleInertiaRequests` middleware. 

```php
class HandleInertiaRequests extends Middleware
{
    public function share(Request $request)
    {
        $ziggy = (new Ziggy())->toArray();

        // During development, send over the entire Ziggy object, so that
        // when routes change we don't have to redeploy.  In production,
        // only send the current URL, as we will bake the Ziggy config
        // into the Lambda SSR package.
        $ziggy = app()->environment('production') ? Arr::only($ziggy, 'url') : $ziggy;

        $ziggy = array_merge($ziggy, [
            'location' => $request->url()
        ]);
        
        return array_merge(parent::share($request), [
            'ziggy' => $ziggy
        ]);
    }
}
```
